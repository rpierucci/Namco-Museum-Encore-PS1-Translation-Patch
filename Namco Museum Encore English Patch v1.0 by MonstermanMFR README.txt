About this project
=======================================

I started this project about a year ago.
While having no experience hacking games,
I decided to start on a project that was
primarily or 100% a graphical hack. Additionally,
my love for Namco Museum games of the PS1 era
made me pursue this project after locating all of
the text in the TIM images using tim2view.

I started this project using Google Translate,
and although I did take Japanese Language in
college for 2 years, that was over 15 years ago
and it's safe to say I didn't study much since
those classes. Since this patch is some basic
receptionist messages and Record menus, I figured
google translate would work well with what I wanted 
to accomplish, which was have the records screen
work so I could play these arcade classics and 
increase my rankings.

While there is more japanese text in some of the TIM images, 
I didn't see them used in game and don't play on translating
that stuff at this point. Maybe they are messages that
show up when you Rank up to S/A rank in the records
screen? I better get playing and maybe at that point
I will translate those as well.
